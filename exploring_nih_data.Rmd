## Exploring the Datasets

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.


```{r NIH data import}
#read nih by state data
nih <- read.csv("2016 NIH funding per state.csv")

#read nih by city data
nih_by_city <- read.csv("2016 NIH funding by city geocoding result.csv")

#read population data
pop <- read.csv("2016 state population.csv")

#get summary of state data
summary(nih_by_city$STATE)

```

Note that there are Canadian provinces and territories in the data, I'm going to throw those out in favor of a traditional 50 states layout.

```{r create subset}
#create subset of nih_by_city for only United States, excluding territories
nih_by_city_clean <- subset(nih_by_city, COUNTRY_1 =="UNITED STATES" & STATE != "AS" & STATE !=  "GU" & STATE != "VI" & STATE != "PR")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
